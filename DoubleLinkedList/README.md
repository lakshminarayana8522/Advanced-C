<h1>Double Linked List </h1>

A double linked list is a linear data structure which is capable to traverse in forward direction as well as backward direction.

Every node in double linked list contains three parts
     1.Information
     2.Address of next node
     3.Address of previous node

The last node of double linked list *next should be NULL indicating end of the linked list.

The first node of double linked list *prev should be NULL indicating start of linked list
