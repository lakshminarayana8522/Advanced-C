  .........FILE Operations......


High level file handling is managed by library functions.
using library functions we can perform I/O operations on files same as I/O operations performed on standard I/O.

The following library functions will be used to perform File I/O operations.

FILE *      :The file handler

fopen       : to open a file

Input/Output

  character I/O : fgetc, fputc
  
  String I/O    : fputs, fgets
  
  Formated I/O  : fscanf, fprintf
 
  Raw I/O       : fread, fwrite


fclose      : To close a file

Other operations

    fflush
    fseek
    freopen
