<h1> Circular Linked List </h1>

Circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no <b>NULL</b> at the end. 
A circular linked list can be a single circular or double circular linked list.

In circular linked list any node can be a starting point. We can traverse the whole list by starting from any point. We just need to stop when the first visited node is visited again.

In circular single linked list the last node contains the address of the first node in the list
