<h1>gcc - GNU project C and c++ compiler.</h1>

Compilation can invoke upto four stages: preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking, always in the order.

<h2> options for controlling the preprocessor</h2>
These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source file before actual compilation.
if we use the -E option, nothing is done except preprocessing.

<h3> -include file </h3>
process file as if #include "file" appeared as the first line of the primary source code..


if above program is compiled it shows error because it does not contain header file.
we can solve the above problem by compiling the program using bellow command
<h2> gcc -include stdio.h prog.c -o prog </h2>
The above command include the header file to the program.
<

<h3> -D name </h3>
 it will Predefine name as a macro, with definition 1.
<div>
#include<stdio.h>

if above program is compiled it shows error because of MAX is undefined.
by using the follwing command we can define the macros
<h2> gcc -D MAX prog.c -o prog </h2>
by default -D name command initialize the macro with value 1.


<h3> -D name=definition </h3>
it will predefine name as macro and intialize with definition.
<div>

#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("%d\n",MAX);
	return 0;
}
</div>

The above program will throw error because of undefined MAX;
the following command will resolve the issue by defining the MAX
<h2> gcc -D MAX=10 prog.c -o prog </h2>


<h3> -pthreads </h3>
Define additional macros required for using the POSIX threads library.

<h3> gcc -wall </h3>

gcc -wall enables all comipler's warnings messages. This option should always be used, inorder to generate better code.

Syntax:  gcc -wall filename.c -o filename


<h3>gcc -shared </h3>

gcc -shared generates the shared object file for shared library.

syntax: gcc -shared filename.c -o filename

<h3>-pipe </h3>
use pipes rather than temparary files for communication between the variour stages of compilation.
