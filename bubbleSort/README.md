<h1>Bubble Sort</h1>

In bubble sort, Each element of array is compared with its adjacent element
A List with N elements requires N-1 passes for sorting.

<h2> Time complexity</h2>
It is defined as how long a program takes to process a given input.
best case time complexity - O(n)
Worst case time complexity - O(n2)
<h2>Space complexity</h2>
It is the total memory space required by the program for its execution.
For bubble sort - O(1)

<h2>bsort1.c</h2>

This file contains the program to implement the bubble sort for integer array.
