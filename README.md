<tr>
<td>Bubble sort</td>
<td>bubble sort is one of the sorting technique. in this it performs the sorting by comparing adjacent elements</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>Selection sort</td>
<td>Selection sort performs sorting by comparing value at index with all the elements in an array</td>
<td><a href="https://github.com/lakshminarayana8522/Advanced-C/tree/main/selectionSort">code</a></td>

<tr>
<td>fork</td>
<td>fork() system call creates a new process, the child, which is an exact duplicate of the calling process, the parent.</td>
<td><a href="https://github.com/lakshminarayana8522/Advanced-C/tree/main/fork">code</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>forkpid</td>
<td>Every process has a process ID and parent process ID.by using getpid() and getppid() system calls we can obtain the process ID and parent process ID</td>
<td><a href="https://github.com/lakshminarayana8522/Advanced-C/tree/main/forkpid">code</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>forkwait</td>
<td>wait() and waitpid() system calls are used to block parent until child terminates and collect the exit status of child upon termination.</td>
<td><a href="https://github.com/lakshminarayana8522/Advanced-C/tree/main/forkwait">code</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IPCNamedpipe</td>
<td>the Named pipe (FIFO) is a interprocess communication technique. that allows communication between the unrelated processes.</td>
<td><a href="https://github.com/lakshminarayana8522/Advanced-C/tree/main/IPC_Namedpipe">code</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>LinkedList</td>
<td>List is a collection of elements. The nodes in linked list are not stored contiguosly in memory.</td>

<tr>
<td>BST</td>
<td>Binary search tree is a binary tree with a rule that left child is smaller than parent and right child is greater than parent</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td> Shared Memory </td>
<td> Shared memory allows two or more processes share the same region of physical memeory.it is faster compared to pipe and message queue IPC techniques. </td>
